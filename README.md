## A Product Pricing API

>It's all about Offers, Deals, and Discounts

### What Motivates Customers to Use Discounts?

1. Direct Reduction in Price :point_right: :moneybag:
  Online retailers issue certain `coupon codes` that customers apply to their orders during checkout. This reduces
  the price.

2. Reward Points Credit :gift:
  Reward points are associated with a particular product or a set of products.
  Shopping portals credit the points to the customer’s account after they complete an order.
  These `reward points` can be redeemed by customers in subsequent `orders.`
  It’s common (but not universal) that one reward point equals a discount of one unit of
  currency (i.e. 1 EUR).

3. Cash Back :money_with_wings:
  Retailers also have `partnerships` with nancial institutions like banks or with wallet services.
  For example, if you pay for an order with a certain bank or credit card,
  a small percentage of the transaction is credited to
  your account. Usually, these cashback offers can be used with any other offer
  or discount offered by the store.
